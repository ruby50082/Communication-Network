# BPSK

## Objective
Implement the generation and detection of BPSK.
  (1) Generate 10^4^ bits of binary random numbers.
  (2) Modulate the binary numbers with BPSK, given that the carrier frequency f~c~ is 1MHz, and the symbol energy E~b~ is 2 dB and frequency is 1 KHz.
  (3) Demodulate the transmitted signal using the block diagram.
  (4) Add the demodulated samples by AWGN noise N(0, N0/2), with N0=1.
  (5) Do symbol detection on the resultant samples.
  (6) Calculate the BER.
  (7) Redo the same experiments with 0 dB ≤ E~b~ ≤ 10 dB
  (8) Draw and compare the BER with the theoretical values.
